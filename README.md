# Pong

The pong game in c++ using sfml

---

## Dependencies

* C++11 at least
* SFML
* make, if you want to use the project's Makefile

If you are on a linux system, you can install all of these with the following command:

	sudo apt-get install g++ make libsfml-dev

Then you just have to prepare the game with the command:
// TO WRITE BEING IN THE REPOSITORIE OF THE GAME //
	
	make

And to launch it with the command:
// TO WRITE BEING IN THE REPOSITORIE OF THE GAME //

	bin/Pong

Feel free to adapt the Makefile to your system, your compiler, etc.

Have fun !
